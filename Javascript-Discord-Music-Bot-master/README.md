Discord Music Bot written in Javascript 

Written during 2024 learning Discord API in Javascript. Independent project. Original built during covid 2020 following a Javascript tutorial, but worked on it in 2024 to understand API usage and functionality. Utilized Discord.JS, a node module allowing me to work with Discords API easily.
Basic bot that allows for music playing, queueing functionality, stopping/starting, and more in a Discord voice call/chat.
